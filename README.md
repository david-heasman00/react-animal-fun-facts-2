# React-Animal-Fun-Facts
Hi there, 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my D3.JS skill journey, I've finished solidifying the [fundamentals of JavaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/details/certifications/1772204395401/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAApMgrcBMeo_oKc9tiGLo0WWsgN6DIbKJb0), and I'm now [learning React at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101). 

(I already have a few [D3 projects](https://theheasman.com/how-i-used-a-market-basket-analysis-to-get-a-job-offer/) [under my belt](https://theheasman.com/data-history-of-uk-interest-rates/), but I would like to learn to build D3 projects with a more modern framework. And, even in the age of AI, I'm a big believer in learning things the hard way.)

This project was part of the React JSX module, and is intended to introduce the syntax of JSX in React.

## What did you learn?

* How the syntax of JSX combines JavaScript and HTML.
* How React controls the Virtual DOM, and how this enables interactive applications/websites to run _a lot_ faster.
* How to create basic conditionals and for...in loops in JSX.

## Where can I view the code?

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
